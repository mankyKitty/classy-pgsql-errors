Classy Instances for PostgreSQL Simple Exceptions.
==================================================

This is just a collection of hopefully useful typeclasses and optics for working
with the `postgresql-simple` library.

It is designed around a specific technique of working with datatypes based on
the `Optics'` typeclass within `lens` and all of the delicious flexibility that
it offers. Yay.

Very much alpha grade software, probably highly opinionated and missing things,
or just flat out wrong. Maybe... *ahem*

errr, enjoy?
